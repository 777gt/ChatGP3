# ChatGP3

A simple chatbot program that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate responses.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you will need an OpenAI API key. You can set your API key by clicking the "Set API Path" button in the top menu of the program. Otherwise, the script will look for a file named "openai_key.txt" in the same directory as the script.

To run it, you can first clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/777gt/ChatGP3.git
```
Then, you will need to install the required Python package for OpenAI and ttkbootstrap. If you already have them, skip this:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Lastly, you can enter the folder and run the script:
```bash
cd ChatGP3
ChatGP3.pyw
```

Once you have set your API key and installed the required packages, you can run the program by running the ChatgGP3.pyw file.

## Usage

To start a conversation with the chatbot, simply type your message into the input box and hit "Enter" or click the "Send" button. The chatbot will respond with a generated message. You can regenerate the chatbot's response by clicking the "♻️" button.

You can save and load conversation histories by clicking the "Save" and "Load" buttons in the top menu. You can also clear the conversation history by clicking the "Clear" button.
